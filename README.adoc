= Customizations for the workstation VM

[NOTE]
====
The `configure-workstation.yml` playbook contains customizations for the workstation VM preferred by Michael Phillips.
You might decide to fork the https://github.com/angelesphillips/workstation-vm repository and make your own customizations.
====

If workstation uses Ansible 2.11 (from the `ansible-core` package) rather than Ansible 2.9 (from the `ansible` package), then install required content collections for the playbook using the `ansible-galaxy` command.
