= Customizations for the workstation VM

[NOTE]
====
The `configure-workstation.yml` playbook contains customizations for the workstation VM preferred by Michael Phillips.
You might decide to fork the https://github.com/angelesphillips/workstation-vm repository and make your own customizations.
====

If workstation uses Ansible 2.11 (from the `ansible-core` package) rather than Ansible 2.9 (from the `ansible` package), then install required content collections for the playbook using the `ansible-galaxy` command.

[student@workstation workstation-vm]$ *ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml*

Copy `sample-variables.yml` and customize it with your information.
Encrypt your copy of the `sample-variables.yml` file using the `ansible-vault` command:

----
[student@workstation workstation-vm]$ *$ ansible-vault encrypt <YOUR-VARIABLES-FILE>*
----

Run the `configure-workstation.yml` playbook using your variables file:

[student@workstation workstation-vm]$ *ansible-playbook configure-workstation.yml -e @<YOUR-VARIABLES-FILE> --ask-vault-pass -K*
