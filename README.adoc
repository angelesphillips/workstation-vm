= Customizations for the workstation VM

[NOTE]
====
The `configure-workstation.yml` playbook contains customizations for the workstation VM preferred by Michael Phillips.
You might decide to fork the https://github.com/angelesphillips/workstation-vm repository and make your own customizations.
====

Copy `sample-variables.yml` and customize it with your information.
Encrypt your copy of the `sample-variables.yml` file using the `ansible-vault` command:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
[student@workstation workstation-vm]$ *$ ansible-vault encrypt <YOUR-VARIABLES-FILE>*
BECOME password: *student*
Vault password: 
_...output omitted..._
----

Run the `configure-workstation.yml` playbook using your variables file:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
[student@workstation workstation-vm]$ *ansible-playbook configure-workstation.yml -e @<YOUR-VARIABLES-FILE> --ask-vault-pass*
